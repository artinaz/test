indemnify COMPANY from any claims relating to COMPANY’s breach of the foregoing or
applicable data protection laws. The terms “business purpose,” “consumer,” “personal

{00690624-2} 5
any purpose other than in performing their respective obligations under this Agreement. Each
Party shall disclose Confidential Information of the other Party only to employees and consultants
subject to confidentiality obligations and having a “need to know” such Confidential Information
in connection with the review or performance of any Services hereunder. Each Party shall use the
same degree of care that it uses to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature and
value, but in no event less than a reasonable standard of care or that required by applicable laws,
to ensure that Confidential Information is not disclosed or distributed by its employees or agents
in violation of the provisions of this Agreement.

indirectly from the disclosing Party; or (c) is lawfully disclosed to the other Party by a third party
without restriction on disclosure; or (d) is independently developed by the other Party. If

making such disclosure, the Party of whom disclosure is required shall give the other Party prompt
written notice thereof and an adequate opportunity to interpose an objection and/or take action to

The terms of this Section 5 shall survive the expiration and termination of this Agreement.
